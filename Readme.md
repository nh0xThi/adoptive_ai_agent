## Overview
The **AI Agent Sample Project** integrates **Pydantic_AI** to create an AI agent capable of learning, making decisions, and processing validated input data. By using **Pydantic**'s data validation and type enforcement alongside machine learning capabilities, the project demonstrates an efficient, robust way to manage AI-driven behavior in Python.

### Key Features:
- **Data Validation with Pydantic**: Automatically validate and ensure that the input data used by the AI agent is correct and structured properly.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Integrates AI-driven decision-making using Pydantic_AI and other popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- **Autonomous Decision-Making**: The agent can act based on its learned models and adapt to new environments and tasks.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to include more features, such as integrating new algorithms or changing the AI’s environment.

## Features
- **AI Decision Engine**: Powered by Pydantic_AI, which uses machine learning models to make intelligent decisions based on validated input data.
- **Automatic Data Validation**: Ensures all data passed to the agent is validated according to Pydantic’s schema and type-checking features.
- **Easy Integration with ML Models**: The agent’s behavior can be adjusted by incorporating pre-trained machine learning models from TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other frameworks.
- **Interactive Learning**: The agent adapts its behavior over time by learning from interactions and feedback.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary language for building the AI agent.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation, schema enforcement, and settings management.
- **Pydantic_AI**: For adding AI capabilities on top of Pydantic to enable the agent’s decision-making process.
- **OpenAI Gym (optional)**: For testing the agent in simulated environments (if reinforcement learning is used).
- **FastAPI**: For creating a web interface (if applicable).

### Prerequisites
- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **Pip** for package management
- **Git** for version control
